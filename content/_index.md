## Hi! I'm a software engineer based in London.

I'm currently working at [G-Research](https://www.gresearch.com), where I'm helping to build a world-class quantitative
research platform. Here's a blog post I wrote about debugging a production issue caused by a bug in the .NET runtime:
[Deep dives in debugging: when it really isn't your fault](https://www.gresearch.com/blog/article/deep-dives-in-debugging-when-it-really-isnt-your-fault)

Previously I worked at Ensoft (now [Cisco](https://blogs.cisco.com/news/cisco-announces-sp-networking-news)), developing
operating systems and software for carrier-class routers. Even more previously, I studied Computer Science at
[Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk).

If you'd like to get in touch with me, then you can email me at hi@seansaville.co.uk. A formal CV/resume is available
on request.
