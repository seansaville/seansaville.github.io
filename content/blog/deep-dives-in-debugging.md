Some time ago, I wrote a blog post about a tricky production issue I dealt with at [work](https://www.gresearch.com)
which ended up being caused by a bug in the .NET runtime.

I won't reproduce the text here, but you can read it on
[the G-Research blog](https://www.gresearch.com/blog/article/deep-dives-in-debugging-when-it-really-isnt-your-fault).
